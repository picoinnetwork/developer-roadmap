Focus for this week was improving the user experience and adding new features to the platform. Here are the highlights:

- New dashboard for logged-in users
- New leaderboard page
- Projects page listing all projects
- Ability to stop a started project
- Frontend and backend content improvements
- Bug fixes

[Dashboard](/) would allow logged-in users to keep track of their bookmarks, learning progress, project and more. You can still visit the [old homepage](https://roadmap.sh/home) once you login.

We also launched a new [leaderboard page](/leaderboard) showing the most active users, users who completed most projects and more.

There is also a [new projects page](/projects) where you can see all the projects you have been working on. You can also now stop a started project.
