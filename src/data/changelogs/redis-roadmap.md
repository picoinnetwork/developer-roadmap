We have a new roadmap, some improvements to dashboard, bookmarks and more.

- [Redis roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/redis) is now live
- Progress and Bookmarks on dashboard are merged into a single section which makes it easy if you have a lot of bookmarks.
- Profile section on [dashboard](/) makes it easy to create profile
- Roadmaps can now be [bookmarked from any page](/roadmaps) that shows roadmaps.
- User profile now shows the projects you are working on.
- [Cyber Security roadmap](/cyber-security) is now filled with new content and resources.
- Buf fixes and improvements to some team features.

Next up, we are working on a new AI Engineer roadmap and teams dashboards.
