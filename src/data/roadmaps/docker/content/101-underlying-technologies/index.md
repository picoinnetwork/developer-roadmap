# Underlying Technologies

Understanding the core technologies that power Docker will provide you with a deeper insight into how Docker works and will help you use the platform more effectively.

## Linux Containers (LXC)

Linux Containers (LXC) enables running multiple independent Linux systems on a single computer. Acting as isolated spaces, LXC containers share host resources like memory and processing power, without needing their own full operating system copy, ensuring lightweight and fast startup.

## Control Groups (cgroups)

Control Groups (cgroups) is a Linux kernel feature that allows the allocation and management of resources like CPU, memory, and I/O to a set of processes.

## Union File Systems (UnionFS)

UnionFS is a file system service that allows the overlaying of multiple file systems in a single, unified view.

## Namespaces

Namespaces are another Linux kernel feature that provides process isolation.
