# SSL vs TLS

Single Sign-On (SSO) is an authentication method that allows users to access multiple applications or systems with one set of login credentials. It enables users to log in once and gain access to various connected systems without re-entering credentials. SSO enhances user experience by reducing password fatigue, streamlines access management for IT departments, and can improve security by centralizing authentication controls. It typically uses protocols like SAML, OAuth, or OpenID Connect to securely share authentication information across different domains. While SSO offers convenience and can strengthen security when implemented correctly, it also presents a single point of failure if compromised, making robust security measures for the SSO system critical.
