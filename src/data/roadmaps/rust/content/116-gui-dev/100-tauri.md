Tauri offers smaller bundle sizes compared to Electron, enhanced security features, and deep system integration. It supports Windows, macOS, and Linux, and provides a unified API for accessing native features across different operating systems. Tauri's architecture allows for custom compile-time optimizations and the use of any front-end framework, making it a flexible and efficient choice for desktop app development.
