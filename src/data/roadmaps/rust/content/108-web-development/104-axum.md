# Axum

Axum is a web framework for building fast and efficient web services in Rust. It is designed to provide a robust and ergonomic way to create HTTP-based services by leveraging Rust's safety features and performance capabilities. Axum is built on top of the hyper library, which is a fast HTTP implementation, and integrates seamlessly with the Tokio runtime for asynchronous programming. Axum is well-suited for developers who want to build high-performance web applications in Rust, with a focus on safety, concurrency, and scalability.
