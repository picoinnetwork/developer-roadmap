# File Parsing

Rust can be used to parse files for the purpose of data extraction, reverse engineering and more using libraries such as `nom`, `pdf-rs`, and `html-parser`. In conjunction with networking libraries like `http`, file parsing libraries can be used to make efficient, powerful web scrapers, while libraries like `pdf-rs` can be used to analyze large quantities of files in bulk for data extraction, classification and machine learning.
