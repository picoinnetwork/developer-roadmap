# Spotlights

Spotlights are a common type of light in computer graphics and games that mimic the behavior of real-world spotlights. They offer a range of parameters to adjust their behavior, such as radius, cone angle, falloff, and intensity.

Spotlights are readily available out of the box in both Unreal and Unity game engines, making them an accessible and powerful tool for adding realistic and dynamic lighting to your scenes.
