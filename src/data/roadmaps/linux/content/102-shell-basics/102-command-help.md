# Command Help

Command help in Linux is an essential feature that enables users to navigate through Linux shell commands with ease. This feature displays brief information on how to use these commands. For instance, typing 'man' before any command brings up the manual entry for that command which explains what the command does, its syntax and the available options. Another popular command is 'help' which is more suited for shell built-in functions, giving a brief description about each. These command line services are extremely beneficial for beginners trying to learn how to use the Linux shell, as well as seasoned users who may need to look up the specifics of seldom used commands. You can also get a TLDR of a command with example usage by using the TLDR package.

To view the manual entry for any command, use:

```bash
man [command]
```

For built-in shell functions, use:

```bash
help [command]
```

To view examples with TLDR, use:

```bash
tldr [command]
```
